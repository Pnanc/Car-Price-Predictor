   # Overview
Predicting used car prices is a classic machine learning problem with practical applications. This project walks through the entire process, from initial data exploration and cleaning to model training and evaluation. It's designed to be a clear and comprehensive example of how to build a predictive model using Python's data science ecosystem.

# Features
1 .Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and transforms categorical features into a format suitable for machine learning models.

2 .Feature Engineering: Creates new features or transforms existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., age of the car from the manufacturing year).

3 .Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes relationships between features and the target variable (price) to gain insights into the dataset.

4.Model Training: Trains a Linear Regression model to learn the patterns in the data.

5 .Model Evaluation: Assesses the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics.

 # Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development, analysis, and presentation.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation (Linear Regression, preprocessing tools).

# How to Run
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Pnanc/used-car-price-prediction.git
cd used-car-price-prediction

2.Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

4.Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

5.Open the notebook:
Navigate to Car-Price-Predictor.ipynb (or similar name) in your browser and open it. You can then execute the cells sequentially to perform the data analysis, model training, and prediction.

# Model & Methodology
This project primarily utilizes a Linear Regression model, a fundamental algorithm in supervised machine learning. The process involves:

Loading the Dataset: Reading the used car data from a CSV file.

# Data Preprocessing:

1.Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).

2.Encoding categorical features (e.g., 'Brand', 'Fuel Type') using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.

3.Potentially scaling numerical features (e.g., 'Kilometers Driven') if other models were to be explored.

4.Feature Selection: Deciding which features are most relevant for predicting car prices.

5.Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's generalization ability.

6.Model Training: Fitting the Linear Regression model to the training data.

7.Prediction & Evaluation: Making predictions on the test set and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.

# Insights & Next Steps
Through this analysis, I  gained insights into:

1.The most influential factors affecting used car prices (e.g., brand reputation, age, mileage).

2.The general trend of depreciation for cars.

3.The effectiveness of a simple Linear Regression model for this prediction task.
