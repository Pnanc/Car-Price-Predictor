# 🚗 Car Price Predictor

A Jupyter-based end-to-end machine learning project to predict the selling price of used cars. Using exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression models (including Random Forest), this project delivers both model insights and practical predictions.

## 📊 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Visualizations, correlation computation, and handling missing values.
- **Feature Engineering** – Transformations such as age calculation, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling** – Regression algorithms including Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation** – Metrics like MAE, RMSE, R²; comparison across multiple models.
  - Inspired by studies using Random Forest to forecast used car prices with ~95% training and ~84% test accuracy :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit‑learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Joblib (or pickle) for model serialization

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Car-Price-Predictor.git
   cd Car-Price-Predictor
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**

   Launch the Jupyter Notebook and run cells in order:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Make Predictions**

   Load `model.pkl` in any Python script to predict prices:

   ```python
   import pickle
   import pandas as pd

   model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
   row = pd.DataFrame({...features...})
   predicted_price = model.predict(row)
   ```

## 📈 Results

| Model             | Train R² | Test R² |
| ----------------- | -------: | ------: |
| Linear Regression |        … |       … |
| Lasso Regression  |        … |       … |
| Ridge Regression  |        … |       … |
| Decision Tree     |        … |       … |
| **Random Forest** |    **…** |   **…** |

*Include your actual performance metrics.*

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Load Dataset**: Read from CSV into a DataFrame.
2. **Clean & Preprocess**: Handle missing data, categorical encoding.
3. **EDA**: Use Seaborn/Matplotlib to explore patterns and outliers.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features like car age, encode fuel type.
5. **Model Training**: Split data and train various regressors.
6. **Evaluation**: Compare via MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics.
7. **Model Export**: Save the best-performing model for reuse.

## 🛠 Future Enhancements

* Integrate a **Streamlit or Flask** web app for live predictions.
* Add **Hyperparameter tuning** (e.g. via RandomizedSearchCV or GridSearchCV).
* Incorporate **Uncertainty Quantification** using models like ProbSAINT ([github.com][3], [arxiv.org][4]).
* Explore **Deep learning** or image-based features for better accuracy.
